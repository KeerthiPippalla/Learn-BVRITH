 I developed an Android application to streamline the process of connecting students with opportunities posted by Admin/ Placement Coordinator. Administrators can quickly upload new job listings,Internship opportunities, free courses, Hackathons, Webinars ensuring that students receive timely notifications. The app's standout feature is its intuitive registration system: when a student registers for a job, the corresponding opportunity card visually indicates their registration by changing its background color to grey. This visual cue helps students easily distinguish between registered and unregistered opportunities, simplifying their job search experience.
